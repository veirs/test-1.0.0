I am using Qt5 running under Ubuntu 14.04

As suggested in the tutorial I created a .pbuilderrc file and put it in my home folder

the file contains:
BASETGZ=$HOME/pbuilder/base.tgz
BUILDPLACE=$HOME/pbuilder/build/
BUILDRESULT=$HOME/pbuilder/result/
DEBEMAIL='Val Veirs <val@beamreach.org>'
BUILDUSERNAME=val
AUTO_DEBSIGN=yes
APTCACHEHARDLINK=no
DEBBUILDOPTS="-sa"

I installed pdebuild and ran the following:

sudo pbuilder --create --mirror "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"

On my development computer, I have all these github files in a folder named temp-1.0.0 (note: hyphen!!!)

I compress this folder via right-click compress selecting .tar.gz

Now I cd to the temp-1.0.0 folder and delete the makefile and run:
dh_make -e val@beamreach.org -f ../temp-1.0.0.tar.gz -s

Then I run pdebuild from inside the temp_1.0.0 folder as follows:

pdebuild --debbuildopts -sa

This builds temp_1.0.0_amd64.deb in the /home/val/pbuilder/result folder

Taking this file on flash drive to 'clean' Ubuntu machine, 
I install it by right-clicking and selecting GDebiPackageInstaller.
